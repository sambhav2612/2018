compiler generates what type of code?	machine instruction code	1 volume
only optimazting the compilers can not influence the generated code to great details. why?&nbsp;	because generated code depends upon the source code as well, the memory usage and data structures used to implement those [what drive the s/w] are also important to note beforehand	1 volume
why s/w engi. is essential to product development?	s/w should have a documentation as well as it should be written in a way that could be read by everyone else with giving away how the s/w works and what variable means what	1 volume
every s/w should be throughly tested for bugs and other issues. why?	a throughly tested code is necessary and essential to product development. plus, debugging is important as well.	1 volume
<div>if you’re not writing efficient code, you’re not writing&nbsp;great code. why?</div>	memory must be saved and the code should execute in minimal time. this could be implemented by optimising compiler [card 1] as well as by improving the code itself.	1 volume
what is machine organization?	it is a subset of computer architecture. defines why the computer arctitect chose a given computer design for implementation.	1 volume
what is machine organisation? [mine]	it is that part of computer architecture which defines how a given computer is organised, i.e., how each underlying parts (s/w + h/w) work with each other to provide a platform for an end-user to run commands, execute programs, etc.	1 volume
values are important to computer. why?	because it is important to note that how a value (not categoried into types) is represented inside a computer. the type of that value could influence in size of the value but the representation remains similar and vital to the machine.	1 volume
arithmetic and logical statments are part of...	writing efficient code	1 volume
each data type must be wisely used. why?	because every data type is implmenented differently on low-level (h/w) and could produce heavy cost [memory and runtime] to the code if implmented inefficiently.&nbsp;	1 volume
each machine instruction executes differently from other. why?&nbsp;	due to it's nature of implementation [how the computer designer designed the instructions to execute]	1 volume
machine instructions and I/O are limited. why?	because every resource at disposal depends on how it is being used by the endusers and the machine itself. proper distribution [or a similar setup] is essential.	1 volume
guidelines for a great code...	- fast<div>- small/concise</div><div>- reliable/robust/debugged</div><div>- readable and expendable</div><div>- properly documented</div><div>- follows language style standards</div><div>- follows soft. engi. guidelines for design</div>	1 volume
what is a great code?	- written using good s/w characterstics<div>- must follow the rules set by the programmer while implemeting an algorithm as source code</div>	1 volume
goal of s/w...	goal of any s/w determines if the code written is good or bad. that could depend on the environment of the s/w being used in [or written for].	1 volume
what is a s/w?	any program written to be used by customers and could be serviced and supported from time to time.	
what's different b/w s/w in web and s/w in web2.0?	web 2.0 will bring remote s/w setup [portability] and will provide more robust methofds to run a s/w w/o installing it on a physical machine. [like pythonanywhere platform]	
why s/w engi. is important?	enables us to provide high quality s/w in a timely manner.	
what constitute SE?	- a process<div>- a set of methods</div><div>- an array of tools</div>	
SE is a...	framework.	
a s/w is a product and a...	carrier of that product.	
failure rate as a function of time...	bathtub curve	
s/w wears out or not?	no it doesn't. it's performance deteriorates. its what h/w is who's performance 'wears' out.	
s/w performance changes with h/w changes. true or false?	yes it does deteriorates. due to h/w changes, periodically the s/w undergoes performance degredation.	
s/w maintainence &gt; h/w&nbsp;maintainence. true or false?	true	
preprocessor phase has...	- inclusion of macros<div>- conditional compilation</div><div>- source files</div>	c-lang
c is low level language. kinda. why?	because c does basic machine work. like processing chars, numbers and addresses.&nbsp;	c-lang
READ WRITE	no. that is extended in high level langs like c++. there is not file i/o in c,	c-lang
READ WRITE 2	c does not has a default support to file i/o but it supports external fxs built for this in several implementations.	c-lang
workflow: single thread or multithread?	singlethreaded sequential.	c-lang
in ansi c [standard c], fxs support argument description. true of false?	true	c-lang
ansi c provided support to external os service s like file i/o and device perminssions. true or false?	true.	c-lang
ansi c's addition of external runtime libs for support to os services was provided to a program by...	implementing the fxs defined in the library explicitly on use. so these runtime libs provide flexibility to them fxs being used as per requirement.	c-lang
c is portable wrt architecture of the underlying machine. true of false?	true.	c-lang
explicit type conversions are rquired in modern c. yes or no?	yes. though original c supported pointer to interger assignment w/o type conversions. ansi c brought explicit type conversions [strictness] to that op.	c-lang
asymptotic notations provide...	upper and lower bound to any function	algorithms
what is an algorithm?	a computational procedure involving inputs to be taken hence producing output out of it. ie., it is a procedure involving computations over input to produce output	algorithms
an algorithm is a tool to solve a computational problem. true or false?	true	algorithms
correct algorithms halt at very instance of input passed. true or false.	true.	algorithms
data structures?	a way to store dat in a organised way so that it could be used and modified gracefully at a later point of time.	algorithms
running time of an algorithm depends heavily over the order of execution of statments at each step. true or false?	true.

however clean the setup is, the data structures used underneath should be implemented so as to take up least runtime and memory. true or false?	true	algorithms
what is a database?	a logically related collection of data where the word 'logic' is of prime importance.	db

database has to meaning to its creation. a userbase intended to that reason and set of applications to follow. true or false?	true.	db
database is a reflection to some real-world entity it simulates in itself. so whenever that entity changes, the db should update its content asap. true or false?	true.	db
